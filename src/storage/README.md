# `src/storage/` — the only database access layer

All `node:sqlite` access is isolated here (spec §3, §11): the connection and
pragmas (079), forward-only migrations with backups (078, 080–092), and
`QuotaRepository` — the typed facade the application consumes (088). Rows are
mapped to typed domain records from `src/schemas/` before leaving this layer.

**Rule:** may import only `src/schemas/` and `src/util/`. No SQL is issued
anywhere else; `QuotaRepository` satisfies the §8.1 "core services" list as
the storage layer's public facade (decision D-009).
